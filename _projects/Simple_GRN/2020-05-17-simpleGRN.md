**Summary:**
A modular GRN can increase evolvability and facilitate the evolution of plasticity and environment-specific gene expression to multiple different environments through the reduction of **pleiotropic effects**, so that expression patterns can evolve independently. However, in a sub-divided population where only a subset of individuals experience a certain environment **selection is reduced** and thus deleterious mutations are more likely to fix while beneficial mutations can be lost because of **increased drift** as the Ne of the trait is decreased. This can result in loss of plasticity due to the increased **mutational load**. On the other hand, this weekend selection can increase the **cryptic genetic variation** in the population that can fuel evolution when the environment switches back. 

**Interesting because:**
Experimental evidence of:

- Bacteria can survive across a **greater range of environments have more modular** metabolic networks than those that are limited to less variable environments 
- 5–50% of the genome may vary in expression with environment
- many genes are expressed across environments, but at different levels
- list of growing support for the prediction that environment-specific genes should accumulate variation within species
- experimental evolution where **adaptation occurs more rapidly in specialists** evolving in constant environments than in generalists evolving in fluctuating

💥 
lack of expression of a focal gene in one environment may only be possible through the induced expression of an **inhibitory transcription factor** recognizing and blocking a specific regulatory site. While the **protein-coding portion** of our focal gene experiences **relaxed** selection, the transcription factor and **regulatory site do not.**

💥
relaxed selection may therefore vary substantially with **network architecture**

#research_idea
Different network architectures have different evolvability because of this? Not just modularity enabled reduced pleiotropy
