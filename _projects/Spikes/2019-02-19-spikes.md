# Neurons

Modelling the spreading of infection was fun but it wasn't a bit unfair for those poor aiport security officers. Every single infected carrier had an equal chance to spread its infection to every outgoing plane. Why not add some kind of threshold that the number of infected individuals in an airport has to reach before they can spread?

Mmmm... that sounds familiar. Isn't it more or less what happens with neurons? They receive impulses from neighbours and if the amount of stimulation reaches a certain threshold they fire a new impulse.
Let's try to model that. The rules of the game are:

-   Neurons fire when the incoming impulses surpass a certain Threshold.
-   Incoming impulses add up, but constantly decay at a fixed rate.
-   Each time a neuron fires the threshold is raised.

{% raw %}

<script>
function resizeIframe(obj) {
obj.style.height = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight + 'px';
obj.style.width = obj.contentWindow.document.body.scrollWidth + 'px';
}
</script>
<iframe frameborder="0" marginheight="20" marginwidth="35" scrolling="no" onload="resizeIframe(this)" src="p5/threshold/index.html"></iframe>
{% endraw %}

Let's see what happens when a lof neurons interact. Since these sketches are running on your computer and I don't want it to catch fire I've encoded the number of impulses travelling on a edge in its thickness. Much easier to render and even nicer to watch. Also, since the edges are semi-transparent you can eye ball the amount of activity in each zone by the intensity of the "redness".

(Hint: use the mouse wheel to release tons of impulses)
